- add sync checks (e.g. is cash/holdings the same?) between client/server to detect bugs
- if block_size > owned, allow it to go to zero
- see if clearing first can help request to redraw screen
- bust should report all players' losses to all players (because it doesn't give much away and could be funny)
- implement chat message entry without getstr(). this is what causes all the drawing artifacts now
    now that event-driven draw operations are synchronized
- add [C]ancel Order to gameboard menu bar (clears pending)
- on client start, get name if not provided (no curses), check server, then start curses

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DONE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- gameboard and client should ignore attempt to submit empty order
- lleft/right arrow keys should not change rows in buysell buttongroup
- buysell approval should not print reqid, should print summary
