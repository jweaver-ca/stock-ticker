- implement a system of allowing multi-colored strings (escape sequences) in label updates, messages etc
- client/server. allow "/cmd args" type messages from clients for system options
- program a time/$ limit ending and announce winner
- client/server. add sync checks (e.g. is cash/holdings the same?) between client/server to detect bugs
- gameboard. if block_size > owned, allow it to go to zero
- gameboard. see if clearing first can help request to redraw screen
	It doesn't look it. I think the artifacts become part of the screen data
	by accident and only by specific call to redraw those areas how they are
	supposed to be will fix.  Or erase whole screen and re-draw all windows.
- server/client. bust should report all players' losses to all players (because
    it doesn't give much away and could be funny)
- implement chat message entry without getstr(). this is what causes all the drawing artifacts now
    now that event-driven draw operations are synchronized
- gameboard. add [C]ancel Order to gameboard menu bar (clears pending)
- client. on start, get name if not provided (no curses?), check server, then start curses
- client. enable [, ] buttons to raise/lower buysell block size
- client. update status to include game name once joined

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DONE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- gameboard and client should ignore attempt to submit empty order
- lleft/right arrow keys should not change rows in buysell buttongroup
- buysell approval should not print reqid, should print summary
- gameboard. ScrollArea should use a curses window
- server. Allow some game options on command line
