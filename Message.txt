Stock Ticker Message protocol
messages are sent between client and server as json representations of python
dictionaries with two keys:  TYPE, DATA
  TYPE is a string to identify the type of message
  DATA is optional data to go along with the message

TODO: Decide if Messages have 2 distinct types or not:
		1. In-game messages relating specifically to game play/game state
		2. Out-of-game/connection messages
	- And should these programmed in a fundamentally different way?
