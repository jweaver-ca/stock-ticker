Basic chat program. Consist of client and server

Server can have many rooms. 
	- 

Client 
	- connects to server
	- login with name. unique to server
	- ability to create room, join room (error if not there)
	- receives messages from joined room, prints to screen with username

HURDLES:
- when client is running, logged in, joined in room, how do you allow input but also
	allow incoming messages to print in terminal?
	> guess i'll have to make a loop and read char by char.  Would prefer no non-standard
		libraries for this...
	> FIX: pip install windows-curses  <-- use curses library
- curses: nodelay() makes getch() non-blocking but this goes full-boar on the processor.
	> HOW-TO: use threading to start using events.

MISC NOTES:
- There is no cross-platform built-in-library-only python solution to reading keyboard input
	directly. curses is probably the easiest option (requiring pip install on windows)
