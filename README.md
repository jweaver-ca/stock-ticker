# stock-ticker
A Client/Server multiplayer version of the classic board game (that is mostly unheard of outside Canada!)

## About Stock Ticker
Players buy and sell stocks on a market that is constantly changing through die rolls made during game play. 
Buy your stocks and hope they go up, sell off the lame ducks, rake in cash from dividends, cry as they go down and ultimately
bust turning your shares into toilet paper!

## About this version
This online version was meant as an exercise in developing online games in python and is not meant to make
gamers swoon 'round the world.
